# Mental Health Awareness — Changelog

## Research & improvements
- Reviewed UX from 988 Lifeline, Mind (UK), Beyond Blue, Crisis Text Line, and Movember to benchmark CTA placement, tone, and helpline prominence. Result: sticky helpline buttons, shorter microcopy, and immediate privacy statements site-wide.
- Borrowed evidence storytelling patterns from CALM and GiveWell to craft Stats + Timeline components, then improved by pairing each metric with a CTA within two scrolls.
- Studied Calm app animations + WHO campaign gradients to inspire soft color palette, GSAP-based depth, and reduced-motion toggle for sensory-friendly journeys.
- Audited donation flows from charity: water and Movember, simplifying to a three-step DonationForm component with impact labels and confidentiality notes.
- Compared resource hubs from NAMI and Headspace; enhanced information scent via ResourceList component with content type, length, and download CTA plus SEO-friendly summaries.
